# Backend SDK

  
  

## About

  

This module is used to parse notifications from [EPNS](http://www.epns.io/). It Provides an abstraction layer
  

It is written in typescript and requires node v10.0.0 or higher.

Most features will work with nodejs v6.0.0 and higher but using older versions than v10.0.0 is anot recommended.

  
## Installation
```javascript
- git clone https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-frontend-sdk-staging.git
- cd epns-frontend-sdk-staging // navigate to the project's directory
- yarn install // to install all the packages
- yarn start //to build the project and watch out for changes
- yarn link // in order to test and be made available locally
// since we intend to test the functionality, we will assume that another react application is running which wants to leverage the components from the framework
- yarn link path_to_sandbox_project/node_modules/react  
- cd path_to_sandbox_project
- yarn link epns-frontend-sdk
// then the library can be imported as normally would if installed using npm or yarn

more information on the testing locally process can be found

```

  

## Usage

import { NotificationItem, ParseText } from  "epns-frontend-sdk";

	notificationBody="\[d:Summary & Latest Balance]\n---------\n\n[âž•] [d:ETH: ] [b:2.961] [t:ETH] [[dg:+-0.000 ETH]][timestamp: 1630069200]"
